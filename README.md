# Awesome Todo App
## starring __**React Native!**__


### 1. Problem Statement

We are always in motion. When we are in motion, we tend to forget things alond the way.
How can we remember to do something while on the go. 

### 2. Solution

This is a well executed phase one of a geoloaction based to do mobile app. The solution is to 
have an app that detects where you are in your travels and sends a reminder to do what is on your list as you approach an opportunity to complete a task. For example, one can set a "to do" to buy milk on the way home from the supermarket. As the user is close to home, a preset is triggered to alert the user that they are within a set distance to the supermarket. Or, when one is on vacation, there will be alerts to remind the user to visit a certain place or buy a particular item. 

### 3. Current Development of this app

Currently, this a robust IOS/ Android capable to do app that has full Create, Read, Edit, and Delete capabilites. The lower tabs are a filtering mechanism to sort between all tasks, completed ones, and those that are still active.

To add - simply type in the upper text field
To edit - hover over the task and press down continuously till the text
          field expands
To delete - click the X next to item
To complete - toggle the switch to strike though item

### 4. App Development and insights

Personally, this project for me was not about building an app. It was about learning
a new technology/ tecnologies is a very compressed amount of time and making something
tht works well and expands my technical expertise.

Concerning the actual app. Learning mobile development involved learning completely new development environments such as Xcode and Android Studio, the phone emulators and the configuration of testable hardware, issues with deployment, vastly different file structures that are essential for mobile platforms, and lastly the most challenging was debugging. In addition, the hardware resources to develop for two platforms at once caused may CPU to consistently run hot. Many times i woulda have to have up to 8 terminal processes running.

The were 5 versions of this app for iteration and 3 complete rebuilds due to errors that could not be diagnosed. The solution in those cases proved that it was cheaper in time to rebuild than to waste hours on errors that may of amy nor be able to be found in time. 

As development progressed, I choose to push the limits of what I could learn and execute in 
a short amount of time. On 2/23 and 2/24 the days were spent learning React Native, and setting up the Dev environments. 2/24, the build began. 2/25 I decided it would be a good idea to learn Redux and Async storage. Though Redux was implented, I could not understand it well enough to move arount the build fast enough so I scrapped it. The same was true with Async storage. In that instance both emulators would not load based on an implementation error with that. That cause rebuild 1. Rebuild 2 was to refactor a working version then came a bug that was not easily traceable. Rebuild 3 occured 1am on 2/28, the day of the presentaion. the error 
was related to an infinite loop in filtering and conditional component rendering.
